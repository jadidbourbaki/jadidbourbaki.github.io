# Research Interests  

My research focuses on the intersection of **theoretical computer science and cryptography**. My areas of interest include:  

- **Privacy-Preserving Data Structures** – Designing efficient structures that protect user data while maintaining performance  
- **Computational Complexity** – Investigating the fundamental limits of computation in modern and unconventional computing models  
- **Applied Cryptography** – Developing real-world cryptographic protocols for emerging applications  
- **Algorithmic Game Theory** – Studying strategic behavior in computational environments  

### **Current Projects**  
- **Privacy Models for Learned Data Structures** – Evaluating security vulnerabilities in modern probabilistic data structures  
- **Computational Complexity of Retro Gaming Systems** – Investigating the hardness of classic games and their implications in theoretical CS  
- **Cryptographic Applications in Biology** – Exploring secure computation techniques for bioinformatics  

If you're interested in these topics, let's discuss potential **[collaborations](/collaborate)**.
